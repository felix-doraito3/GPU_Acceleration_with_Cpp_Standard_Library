## Introduction

This course is designed for students, developers, researchers, and practitioners who are familiar with C++11 features such as lambdas and the Standard Template Library (STL). It emphasizes portability, performance, and modern C++ practices, particularly those introduced in C++17 and C++20.

The course covers:
- Basic concepts in C++ (lambdas, STL algorithms).
- Parallel algorithms and their execution on CPUs and GPUs.
- Techniques for optimizing code using modern C++ features.
